                <p> 
                The University of Santo Tomas or UST is known as the official Pontificial, Royal, and Catholic University
                of the Philippines. Standing as Asia's oldest existing university with 414 years of teaching (and older than Harvard), 
                and among the largest Catholic universities in the world regarding student densities in a single campus. It offers a wide 
                range of degree programs ranging from the natural, health, applied, social and sacred sciences, to business and management.

            <h2> History </h2>
            <p> 
                UST was founded in 1611, after 
                <em>Miguel de Benavides</em>
                , known as the third Archbishop of Manila, allocated funds in 1605 for a seminary-college.
                It was initially named 
                <em>Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario</em>
                but later renamed to 
                <em>Colegio de Santo Tomás</em>
                . 
            </p>

            <p> 
                In 1645, Pope Innocent X elevated it to the status of a university. Over time it received royal patronage from the 
                Spanish crown (under King Charles III), and was recognized as a Pontifical University in 1902. Later in 1947 it was 
                given the title “Catholic University of the Philippines.” Its campus moved from its original site in Intramuros to 
                its present area in Sampaloc, Manila in 1927, and has endured disturbances during the Philippine Revolution and WWII.
