        <h3> History </h3>
        <p> UST was founded in 1611, after Miguel de Benavides, known as the third Archbishop of Manila, allocated funds in 1605 for a seminary-college.
            It was initially named Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario but later renamed Colegio de Santo Tomás. (Cite) 
        </p>

        <p> In 1645, Pope Innocent X elevated it to the status of a university. Over time it received royal patronage from the Spanish crown (under King Charles III),
            and was recognized as a Pontifical University in 1902. Later in 1947 it was given the title “Catholic University of the Philippines.” Its campus moved from 
            its original site in Intramuros to its present area in Sampaloc, Manila in 1927, and has endured disturbances during the Philippine Revolution and WWII. (Cite)
